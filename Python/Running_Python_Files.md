## Running Python Files

For some dataset reproductions, it may be necessary to run Python files. The following instructions are for running Python files on a Mac, but the process is likely similar for Windows and other operating systems as well:
- Download the Anaconda Navigator from [https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). This is a software that will help you run Python files.
- Open the Anaconda Navigator. You will see the option to lauch several different softwares for running code files. Each software is different and serves a different purpose, so you may need to play around with the different softwares a bit to figure out which software is right for what you need to do. In general, I found the software named 'Spyder' to be helpful and easy to use. 
- If using Spyder, you can open files using the folder button on the top left and then run the entire file by clicking on the green arrow in the top bar.
