## Resolve Issues with .DS_Store

#### What is .DS_Store

In the Apple macOS operating system, .DS_Store is a file that stores custom attributes of its containing folder, such as the position of icons or the choice of a background image.

#### Resolve the Issue Manually for a Quick Fix

When GitHub GUI asks you to resolve merge conflict by going to the command line because of .DS_Store, you could resolve the conflict by running the following commands:

1. Change your working directory to the destination folder  
  * `cd filepath_to_your_destination_folder`  

You could find steps below on GitHub GUI pull request page (step one from `Checkout via command line` option in GH:

2. Checkout the branch that the pull request is trying to merge from  
  * `git checkout -b branch-name master`

3. Pull from the repo where the pull request is trying to merge from
  * `git pull https://github.com/userhandle/URAP-week-progress.git master`

Now we remove the file from the merging folder and sync it

4. Remove the .DS_Store file
  *  `rm .DS_Store`

5. Add and commit all the changes
  * `git add -A`
  * `git commit -m "Remove .DS_Store file"`

Go back to the master branch and merge the pull request

6. Checkout the master branch  
  * `git checkout master`

7. Merge the pull request
  * `git merge --no-ff branch-name`

8. Sync the remote repository  
  * `git push origin master`

PULL REQUEST MERGED!

#### Add .DS_Store to .gitignore file

We can also add .DS_Store to our .gitignore file which essentially tells Git to ignore certain files. Here we add a .gitignore file at our root directory.

If it doesn't work because we've already added .DS_Store in earlier commits and Git is now tracking it even though it got added to our .gitignore file recently, we could follow these steps:

1. Remove the .DS_Store files that were in your repository  
  * Removes the .DS_Store from current directory:`git rm --cached .DS_Store`  

  * If you need to remove all .DS_Store files from the repository, run:  
    + `find .-name .DS_Store -print0 | xargs -0 git rm --ignore-unmatch`

2. Then commit and push the changes  
  * `git commit -m "Remove .DS_Store from everywhere"`
  * `git push origin master`
