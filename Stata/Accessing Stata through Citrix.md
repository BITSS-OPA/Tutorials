# Accessing Stata through Citrix

You will likely need to access Stata at some point while working with BITSS. We can do this through Citrix, a service that provides access to certain research tools for free.

Below are the main points to set up your Citrix access (from the UC Berkeley Library page on [Using research tools via Citrix](https://guides.lib.berkeley.edu/c.php?g=267678&p=1786115)); please visit the page for more detailed instructions.  

- First, download and install the Citrix Workspace App from [their website](https://www.citrix.com/downloads/workspace-app/)
- Then, go to https://citrix.berkeley.edu/ and log in with your CalNet ID and passphrase. This is how you will launch the Citrix App each time you need to access stata.

** A common error is the "KeyAccess" error - currently, only 20 users can use Stata through Citrix at the same time. If you see this error, wait a bit and try launching Stata again later.
