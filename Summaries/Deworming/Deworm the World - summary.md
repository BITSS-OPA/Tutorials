#### Summary
Parasitic worm infections, also known as soil-transmitted helminths (STH) and schistosomiasis, interfere with regular bodily processes by decreasing nutrient uptake and thereby contributing to malnourishment and impairment of mental and physical development. Evidence Action advocates for mass school-based deworming because of the impact on school participation, nutrition and cognition, and the cost-effective nature of mass treatment. Their partnership model focuses on seven components:
1. Policy and Advocacy - working with governments to launch deworming programs and working with "ministries of health and education to establish effective policies and governance structures"
2. Prevalence Surveying and Mapping - working to assess the prevalence and intensity of worm distribution through field surveys
3. Program Planning and Management - working with governments to design their deworming programs, develop operational plans and budgets, coordinate logistics, and providing on-the-ground support
4. Public Awareness and Mobilization - developing locally appropriate campaigns that educate communities about the negative effects of worms, the importance of deworming, and how to prevent further infections
5. Training and Distribution Cascade - supporting governments in the design and coordination of "efficient multi-tier training and distribution cascades" that are tailored to the relevant local context.
i.e., the cascade from national level --> state level --> teachers (who administer the deworming drugs)
6. Drug Management and Coordination - evaluating appropriate treatment strategies, aiding in drug procurement (including through pharmaceutical donation programs), and developing robust protocols for tracking drug inventories
7. Monitoring and Evaluation - helping governments design systems to monitor and measure effectiveness of programs in achieving intended results. They also conduct independent monitoring to validate such results and to evaluate the impact of the programs in reducing worm prevalence and intensity.

Active in: Nigeria, Ethiopia, Kenya, Pakistan, India, Vietnam
