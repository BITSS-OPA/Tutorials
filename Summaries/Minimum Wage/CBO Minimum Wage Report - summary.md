#### Summary
__High level overview__
This report by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) looked at the effects of increasing the federal minimum wage from $7.25/hour to $10, $12, or $15 per hour by 2025 on employment rates and family income, starting January 1, 2020. Of these options, __the increase to $15/hour would have the largest impact__ on employment and family wages because it would increase wages for the most workers, it would impose the largest increase in wages, and because the CBO estimates the largest response from employers due to the indexing of the minimum wage and the elimination of exceptions. As neither of those factors would impact the response to either the $12 or $10 options, the response to such increases would be less severe but the benefits would also be more negligible.

The estimates regarding the size of any option's effects on employment have "considerable uncertainty" due to __uncertainty about wage growth__ under current law and __uncertainty about the responsiveness of employment__ to a wage increase. To combat this uncertainty, the CBO's estimates are based upon the median values for the likely ranges of wage growth and responsiveness of employment to changes in wages. However the likely ranges for the responsiveness parameter are asymmetric - that value has an equal chance of being smaller or larger than the median, but that values larger than the median could be substantially larger.

Additionally, although numerous studies have found a link between minimum wages and a range of other outcomes outside of employment and family income, this report does not examine those outcomes in this analysis. Nor did the CBO examine the impact of these three options on the federal budget, though a previously produced report analyzes a similar policy's impact on the federal budget.

##### Context on the Minimum Wage
The federal minimum wage was first established by the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA). Under the current law, most low-wage workers are covered, though there are a few exceptions that either qualify its mandate or where it simply doesn't apply.

Under the former category, where workers are subject to a modified version of FLSA, there are several different arrangements for different industries and situations.
1. <u>Tipped workers</u> (*e.g.*, servers and bartenders): subject to two separate minimum wages
  a. <u>Total hourly earnings</u> (including tips) must equal or exceed the regular minimum wage ($7.25), while separately,
  b. <u>"Cash earnings"</u> (excluding tips) must exceed $2.13 per hour
  *There are an estimated 3 million workers whom are subject to these modified provisions.*

2. <u>Teenage workers</u>: employers are allowed to pay teenage workers $4.25/hour during their first __90 days__ of employment

3. <u>Disabled workers</u>: employers certified by the Department of Labor are allowed to pay disabled workers wages that are below $7.25/hour if those lower wages are justified by "analyses of prevailing wages and worker productivity".
  *There are an estimated 125,000 such workers.*

Under the latter category, where workers are not subject to the FLSA at all, there several categories of workers.
1. Workers that are self-employed
2. Employees who work for certain small employers
3. Workers who are paid on a per project basis rather than an hourly basis

The federal minimum wage was most recently raised from $5.15/hour in July 2007 to $7.25/hour in July 2009. However, it has remained stagnant since then. Though the real value of the minimum wage has fluctuated over the years, the nominal increases have been "eroded by inflation", especially at times where the nominal minimum wage has remained unchanged.

As of 2019, 29 states and the District of Columbia have instituted a higher minimum wage than that established on the federal level, especially within recent years. In 17 of those states, the minimum wage has been indexed to inflation, and future increases have been mandated in 6 more. Additionally, some localities have higher minimum wages than the relevant state or federal  mandates. The CBO specifically cites the example of San Francisco, which increased the minimum wage to $15.59/hour (as of July 1, 2019) and adjusts for inflation annually. However, though there are many states where the local minimum wage is higher than the federal minimum wage, the majority of American workers, 60%, currently live in states where the applicable minimum wage is more than $7.25/hour. The CBO estimates that by 20205, about 30% of workers will live in states with a minimum wage of $15 or higher.

Increasing the minimum wage would have two main, competing effects on low-wage workers: for some families, there would be an increase in earnings and family income (thus lifting some families out of poverty), but other workers would become jobless as a result (thus causing family income for these individuals to fall below the poverty threshold).

##### The Analysis - Three Options for Increasing the Minimum Wage
Various options for raising the minimum wage have been proposed by lawmakers, in particular, the Raise the Wage Act (H.R. 582) which would increase it to $15/hour and subsequently index it to growth in median wages. With this piece of legislation in mind, the CBO considered three options which differed based upon the amount of nominal increase, whether it indexed to median hourly wages, and whether it eliminated or changed certain exceptions to the minimum wage (detailed above).

__Increase to $15 Minimum__
Increase the federal minimum wage from $7.25/hour to $15/hour by 2025, based upon the proposed Raise the Wage Act
- five annual increases of $1.30 beginning on January 1, 2020
- final increase of $1.25 on January 1, 2025
- total of six increases
- after reaching $15/hour, the minimum wage would then subsequently be indexed to growth in median wages
- after 2025, the CBO expects for this minimum wage option to grow, as it would be indexed (median wages are expected to grow faster than the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or inflation)
- the increase in the federal minimum wage between 2020 and 2025 would be __~105%__, a percent increase which would be considerably higher than mandated by previous legislation

_Impact on Exceptions_:
- essentially phases out several exceptions
- <u>tipped workers</u>: wages would immediately increase from __$2.13/hour to $3.60/hour__, and then increase by __$1.50 each year__ until it reached the regular minimum wage (projected to occur in 2029)
- <u>teenage workers</u>: the lower minimum would increase from __$4.25/hour to $5.50/hour in 2020__, and would continue to increase by __$1.25 each year__ until the regular minimum wage is reached (projected to occur in 2028) and the lower minimum is thus eliminated
- <u>disabled workers</u>: the lower minimum for disabled workers would rise to __$4.25 in 2021__, too __$6.40 in 2022__, to __$8.55 in 2023__, to __$10.70 in 2024__, to __$12.85 in 2025__, and to the regular minimum wage in 2026. For the purposes of the CBO analysis, they applied the regular minimum wage to disabled workers in 2025.

In short, the $15 option would have an unprecedented (at least in recent history) effect on wages by CBO estimates. Compared the wage distribution under current law, this minimum wage increase would be in the 20th percentile of projected hourly wages in 2025 (higher in the wage distribution than it has been since 1973). And the mandated increases necessary to reach the new minimum (amounting to 21% on average) would also be greater than those under any recent change to the federal minimum wage.

__Increase to $12 Minimum__
Increase the federal minimum wage from $7.25/hour to $12/hour by 2025
- six annual increases of ~$0.79 beginning on January 1, 2020 and ending January 1, 2025
- after 2025, the CBO expects for this minimum wage option to shrink (in real terms), as it would not be indexed to median wages and thus would be eroded by inflation in later years
- exceptions to the minimum wage would not be impacted (*i.e.*, the lower minimum wages for tipped, teenage, and disabled workers)

This minimum wage option would be more similar to past minimum-wage increases in terms of the fraction of employed workers that it would affect and the size of the wages increases it would mandate
- 4% of workers would be impacted in 2025
- mandated increases in wages would amount to ~14% on average

__Increase to $10 Minimum__
Increase the federal minimum wage from $7.25/hour to $10/hour by 2025
- six annual increases of ~$0.46 beginning on January 1, 2020 and ending January 1, 2025
- like the $12 increase, after 2025, the CBO expects for this minimum wage option to shrink (in real terms), as it would not be indexed to median wages and thus would be eroded by inflation in later years
- like the $12 increase, exceptions to the minimum wage would not be impacted (*i.e.*, the lower minimum wages for tipped, teenage, and disabled workers)

This minimum wage option would have effects smaller than those of the past three most recent increases in the federal minimum wage in terms of the fraction of employed workers that it would affect and the size of the wages increases it would mandate
- 1% of workers would be impacted in 2025
- mandated increases in wages would amount to ~7% on average

###### Uncertainty in the Outcomes
As previously mentioned, the two main causes of uncertainty and thus potential error in this report are uncertainty in future wage growth under the current laws and uncertainty regarding the responsiveness of employment to an increase in the minimum wage.

Regarding future wage growth uncertainty, if wages grow faster than CBO projections, then  increases in the federal minimum wage would have less of an impact on employment than expected. However, if wages grow more slowly than projected, then increases in the federal minimum wage would have a larger effect on employment than expected.

Regarding the uncertain responsivity of employment to changes in the minimum wages, a similar trend follows. If employment is more responsive than expected by the CBO, then increases in the minimum wage would lead to larger declines in employment (*i.e.*, an increase in the number of workers who would become jobless as a result). However, if employment is less responsive than expected, then wage increases would lead to smaller declines in employment. This factor is particularly uncertain as findings in the literature are very varied - some studies have found little or no effect while others have found substantial reductions in employment.

#### Conclusions
###### Effects of Each Minimum Wage change

__*$15 Minimum*__:
- boost wages for __17 million workers__ (who would otherwise earn less than $15/hour)
- __10 million workers__ otherwise earning slightly more than $15/hour might also see their wages rise as well
- __1.3 million workers__ would become jobless (according to the CBO's median estimate)
  - equivalent to an 0.8% reduction in the number of employed workers
  - projected change in employment range: 0 to -3.7 million workers
  - confidence level: 2/3 chance
- number of people with an annual income below the poverty threshold in 2025 would fall by __1.3 million__
  - the CBO estimates that families whose income would be *below* the poverty threshold under the current minimum wage would receive an additional __$8 billion__ in real family income
- would reduce *total* real family income in 2025 by __$8.8 billion (0.1%)__
  - real income would fall by about __$16 billion__ for families *above* the poverty line (0.1%)

In short, the $15 option would:
- boost worker's earnings through higher wages, but some of those higher earnings would be offset by higher rates of joblessness
- reduce business income and thus raise prices as higher labor costs absorbed by business owners would then be passed on to consumers
- reduce the nation's output slightly through the reduction in employment and thus a decline in the nation's "stock of capital"

Additionally, the effects of those income changes would be nonuniform across families, with changes in earnings primarily affecting low-income families (positively) and negatively impacting higher-income families as the loss in business income would mostly be borne by families well above the poverty line. All consumers would pay higher prices as a result of businesses absorbing higher labor costs, but higher income families, who spend more, would thus pay more of those costs.

__*$12 Minimum*__:
- boost wages for __5 million workers__ (who would otherwise earn less than $12/hour)
- __6 million workers__ otherwise earning slightly more than $15/hour might also see their wages rise as well
- __0.3 million workers__ would become jobless (according to the CBO's median estimate)
  - equivalent to an 0.2% reduction in the number of employed workers
  - projected change in employment range: 0 to -0.8 million workers
  - confidence level: 2/3 chance
- number of people with an annual income below the poverty threshold in 2025 would fall by __0.4 million__
  - the CBO estimates that families whose income would be *below* the poverty threshold under the current minimum wage would receive an additional __$2.3 billion__ in real family income
- would reduce total real family income in 2025 by $0.7 billion (0.05%)
  - real income would fall by about __$3 billion__ for families *above* the poverty line ("a very small share of their total income")

__*$10 Minimum*__:
  - boost wages for __1.5 million workers__ (who would otherwise earn less than $10/hour)
  - __2 million workers__ otherwise earning slightly more than $15/hour might also see their wages rise as well
  - __little effect__ on employment
    - projected change in employment range: 0 to -0.1 million workers
    - confidence level: 2/3 chance
  - negligible effects on the number of people in poverty
    - the CBO estimates that families whose income would be *below* the poverty trheshold under the current minimum wage would receive an additional __$0.4 billion__ in real family income
  - negligible reduction in total real family income (less than $0.1 billion)
    - families *above* the poverty line would see very small changes to their real income
