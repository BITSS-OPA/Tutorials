# Summer Funding

*If you've worked on the same URAP project for at least two semesters,* you are eligible to be nominated by your faculty mentor for a stipend through the [URAP Summer Award](https://urap.berkeley.edu/summer-stipends).  

* Mentors submit nominations by the end of March
* Awards are for $3000, and apprentices are required to work about 200 hours over the summer
* Nomination does not guarantee an award; this depends on the available funding for the summer.

*If you haven't worked on the project for at least two semesters,* you must look into non-URAP funding sources.  

* [CNR Summer Internship Grant](https://nature.berkeley.edu/advising/internship-grant) (open to CNR majors only):
  * Awards range from a few hundred to $3000

    * Personal statement must include a description of "how the work contributes to fostering greater social equity and inclusion"
  * Open to students who received need based financial aid in the current academic year
  * You must
  * Internship can be paid or unpaid, must last at least 4 weeks
  * Application due in mid- to late April
* [UC Berkeley Scholarship Connection](https://scholarships.berkeley.edu/scholarships/type):
  * Database of scholarships, including private scholarships. Note that these are not limited to summer internships, so you will need to spend some time combing through to find a scholarship/grant you are eligible for.
* Other scholarship search engines, such as [Unigo](https://www.unigo.com/scholarships/by-type) and [FastWeb](https://www.fastweb.com/); I suggest using these after you've looked through the options above because they're very broad.
